<span style='color:brown'>
1. mpg dataset is loaded from seaborn library <br>
2. data is visualized to gain some useful information and evaluation of data.<br>
3. dataset is transformed using tranformers and custom tranformers to refined into suitable data for 
   feed into ml model . data is scaled , imputed . categorical data is converted into numerical data 
   using one hot encoding and ordinal encoding . missing values are treated using simpleimputer class
   from sklearn library . <br>
4. multiple models used to check test accuracy and test error ,for selecting best model and 
   linear regression model seemed good and is selected to predict milage . <br>
5. milage is predicted on some real data. </span>
